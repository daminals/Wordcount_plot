This project is a great entry point to data science, and allows you to do simple data analysis at a glance. Although my read.txt file contains the contents of Gatsby, yours can be any piece of writing -- even my article! You could compare writers' work to their other works and see which authors have a preference for certain letters, or which of their works are unique in their letter composition

This project allows you to expand more than your programming knowledge, but you analysis skills.
